# Differences between flex, inline and grid

### Each of the values of the "display" property has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of the layout of a web page.

* Display: inline is useful for layout elements that must appear inline, such as links, and is easy to use and
understand.

* Display: flex is a more advanced and versatile option for layout elements that need to be aligned and adapted to the
size of the screen. It allows a large number of options for the alignment and layout of elements, making it more
suitable for more complex projects.

* Display: grid is an even more advanced option that allows a large number of options for the layout of elements in a
grid. It is ideal for projects that require a more complex and rigorous structure, such as a table.
