|-------------|---------------|
| "string"    | Double quotes |
| 'string'    | Single quotes |
| \`string\`  | Backticks     |
| <<<ABC ABC; | Heredoc       |

### String concatenation
| Type        | Description         |
|-------------|---------------------|

| ,           | Comma               |
| print       | Print               |
| printf      | Print with format   |
| var_dump    | 'string(5) "Hello"' |
